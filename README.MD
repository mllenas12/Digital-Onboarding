# Digital Onboarding

Digital Onboarding is a project built with React, Typescript and Tailwind that provides recomendations to kickstart a new development course.

The screen displays an image with a recomendation and you can navigate to the next or the previous one using the arrow buttons. Additionally, you can navigate between different cards by clicking the indicators located in the bottom left side of the card.

## Here's a demonstration of what you will find:
